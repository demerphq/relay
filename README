simple(~500 lines) socket<->socket relay that listens on
unix/udp and enqueues packets into several several workers, which sends them to
their destination. It also uses TCP_CORK on 1 streaming tcp
connection to send its data (if remote socket is tcp).
install:
    $ git clone https://github.com/jackdoe/relay
    $ cd relay
    $ make
    $ # and then run ./bin/relay 
usage:
relay local_socket fallback_socket worker_socket worker_socket worker_socket ....

for exmple:
relay /tmp/relay.sock udp@events-fallback.example.com:112233 tcp@events-0.example.com:112233 \
    tcp@events-1.example.com:112233

There enqueuement attempt on each worker's thread (in case someone's queue is full
or the worker is in aborted state) until the packet is enqueued. If all worker threads
fail the packet is enqueued in the fallback worker's queue.

Each thread tries to send the packet, and if it fails it tries to requeue it
into other threads (except if this thread is the fallback, then we exit with error) and
then it puts itself into abort state, while it attempts to reconnect.

listener socket can be only DGRAM udp/unix.

                -> if disaster happens (unable to send packet) then
                   pick other worker(b) to process my queue.
                   -> if no worker is found then attempt to enqueue in 
                      fallback worker's queue

testing:
    $ cd relay/test
    $ ./setup.sh
    # after testing is done you can see the results
    $ ./stat.sh  | sort -n -t'-' -k 2
